# Exploring-London-s-Travel-Network-in-SQL
How do Londoners get around? Transport for London (TfL) is a vast public transport network that allows London's residents to efficiently travel around the UK's capital, to the tune of over 1.5 million journeys per day!

In this introductory project, i work with a Snowflake database containing data on journeys and transport types in London between 2010 and 2022. and write SQL queries to find the most popular transport methods, examine when the London cable car (which connects London's Royal Docks, where the Mayor's office is located, to Greenwich Peninsula, home of the O2 arena) was particularly busy, and identify rare periods when the Underground (also known as "the tube" to locals) was less busy.
